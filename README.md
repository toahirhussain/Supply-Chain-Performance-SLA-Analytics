# Supply-Chain-Performance-SLA-Analytics
End-to-End Data Modeling, SQL (BigQuery), and Power BI Dashboard

## 📌 Business Problem

> Supply chain leaders need visibility into delivery reliability, inventory risk, and profitability to ensure operational efficiency and meet service level agreements (SLAs).
> However, raw logistics data is often fragmented across shipments, products, suppliers, and carriers, making it difficult to identify performance gaps, cost drivers, and SLA risks in a timely manner.

## 🎯 Project Goal

> The goal of this project was to design an end-to-end analytics solution that transforms raw logistics data into actionable insights across:

  > - Delivery performance and SLA compliance
  
  > - Inventory risk and stock optimization
  
  > - Cost and profitability analysis
  
  The solution enables business stakeholders to monitor performance, identify risks, and support data-driven operational decisions.


## ❓ Key questions the project answers
  • Are shipments meeting SLA delivery targets?
  • Which carriers and routes contribute most to late deliveries?
  • Where does inventory risk exist across product categories?
  • Are we generating revenue efficiently relative to costs?
  • Which products and suppliers drive high revenue but low margins?
